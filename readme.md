** description**
    in the pacman exercise, we looped through our array of pacmen with an arrow function to give them random speeds and directions.  we also check for collisions and use setTimeout to update the function every 0.2 seconds.
    
 **instructions:**
    
    1.  save files .css .html locally on your machine in the same directory.  open google chrome and simply drag and drop the index.html file into your             google console.  
      if google chrome is your default browser, you may simply double click the index.html file. 
    
      the animation will then appear and you will see the eyes following your mouse movements. 
    
** coming**

  i hope to use this same approach in future repos, specifically to animate web pages but also to build applications utilizing the full manipulation offered   by these very powerful javascript expressions and loops.
